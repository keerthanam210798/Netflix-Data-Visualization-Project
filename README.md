Netflix Data Visualization & Business Insights Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project explores Netflix’s Movies and TV Shows dataset to uncover content trends, genre patterns, rating distributions, and global production insights.

Using Power BI, I developed an interactive dashboard that transforms raw streaming data into meaningful business insights. The dashboard allows users to dynamically explore Netflix’s content library through filters, KPIs, and visual storytelling.

This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world data using modern BI tools.

🎯 Business Problem

Streaming platforms rely heavily on data-driven decisions to:
